## binary-classification-using-logistic-regression-model
In this repository you will find the sample binary classification problem in machine learning using logistic regression model.<br>


This model will predict the cat vs not cat images. This repositary consists of one jupyter notebook file 
"cat_vs_non_cat_notebook.ipynb", one python file "logistic_regression_cat_vs_non_cat.py" and two hdf5 files "test_catvnoncat.h5" and "train_catvnoncat.h5"

This is a simple model for solving classification problems in machine learning using logistic regression.

The jupyter notebook consists of detail explanation of the code along with the result of execution and iterations. 

#Technologies <br>
Codes are written in python with v.3.7.
